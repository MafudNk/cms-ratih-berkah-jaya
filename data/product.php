        1.  Botanical Origin: 
           Nutmeg comes from the evergreen tree Myristica fragrans, which produces both nutmeg and mace (another spice derived from the red aril covering the seed). The tree is known for its aromatic qualities.
        
        2.  Physical Appearance: 
           The nutmeg seed is oval-shaped, approximately one inch long, and covered with a reddish-brown, lacy membrane known as mace. When the seed is dried, it shrinks and rattles inside its shell, producing the distinct sound that gave rise to its name.

            12.  Harvesting Process:
